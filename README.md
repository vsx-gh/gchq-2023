Solutions to the GCHQ Christmas Challenge 2023

**WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!**

This repo contains my work on the GCHQ Christmas Challenge 2023. This was a really fun set of puzzles, and I am incredibly glad I heard about it! Too bad I didn't see last year's puzzle, but I can always go back and work that one at my leisure.

I used a whiteboard for almost all of my work here. I just think better that way for puzzles. After figuring out the alphabet substitutions for question 7, I wrote a short Python program to automate outputting the deciphered sentences. My Python sucks - be kind.

 The answers to some of these questions revealed themselves before I had solved them. Mainly this resulted from my filling out the Final Challenge answer as I went along. That said, I did the work on this myself. I stumbled onto some clues for the first line of question 5 online, but quickly closed my browser afterward; the rest of the work is mine.

Fun stuff: I am not at all British enough for question 3, but I made my way through it. Otherwise I find these questions to be fairly neutral and therefore very approachable by just about any English speaker. Hooray!

The whiteboard photos show my thought process as I worked through each question. These are by nature very jumbled. No apologies offered.

Please see `Thoughts.md` for my approach and/or thought process for each question.

Challenges like these are incredibly fun and can really spark interest in this kind of work in all kinds of folks. That can lead to all kinds of fantastic outcomes, from simple enjoyment to lifelong careers! I really applaud GCHQ for putting this out. I had a blast solving these problems, for sure.
