# Thought Process, General Notes

**SPOILERS! Don't read further unless you have solved the Challenge, gave up, or don't intend to do it.**

### Question 1
Pretty straightforward alphabet problem. Denoting AM/PM was the immediate clue for me and is what leads you to find the corresponding alphabet position/letter. Very nice that the answer lines up with the clues.

### Question 2
"Seize" tipped me off here. For some reason I thought of eggs when reading the first line, not sure why.

### Question 3
Not British/English enough! I didn't know that Declan is a type of rice, but I got that grouping pretty quickly. I also learned about Pudsey the Bear and its namesake town. I was fairly deep into this one before checking whether the towns are all in Yorkshire - they are. After those first two answers I had "pudding" all locked up, but didn't know what the last group had to do with that. My unfamiliarity with _Harry Potter_ is also hilarious here, as I was searching really hard for "Sirius bread" before getting "black" for the other terms.

### Question 4
Arithmetic fun. After noticing the need for the product to start with the same digit as the factors in the first question, I found 12 x 12 and was off. I _believe_ that "O" here can be "8" or "7" without any problems. I chose "8", but there was no major reason behind that. You just have to get to "RE" being "60" for it to work; you want the product to be "3600" to correspond with "TREE", using the alphabet/digit system you derived.

### Question 5
Probably the hardest for me after Question 3. I accidentally saw a hint for the first line and closed out my browser immediately after. It became pretty obvious that the same approach could not be applied to every line in this problem. I went with my gut on "WRAPPING", which reinforced my suspicion that the answer is "STOCKING". 


### Question 6
Good ol' binary problem. Not terribly difficult but also requires you to set out your binary tables again (see whiteboard screenshots). From figuring out the Final Challenge I already knew the answer to this one, but I still needed to work it out and prove it. This was my second-favorite question.

### Question 7
My favorite! This is just a regular cryptanalysis question. First hints for me were the standalone "c", which would be "a" or "I". The "gq'l" was next, which was either "it's" or "it'd" (the latter almost totally unlikely). "qom" is "and" or "the", but I chose "the". Knowing that "4" was just plain "4" kept the train rolling. After that it was just a matter of plugging known values in and finding the rest. A fun added twist is that you don't end up having a 1:1 correspondence between the two alphabets; a few letters are just not used and are therefore left out. Again, I knew "FILM" here from the Final Challenge, but I wanted to prove it. Plus, I like deciphering like this.

After figuring out the cipher alphabet, I tested it using a short Python program.

### General Thoughts
I know this is geared toward kids, but solving the Challenge was incredibly rewarding and brought a lot of of enjoyment. If nothing else, I discovered that my brain still works, and not all that badly!
